## Banana-Leaf-Disease-Detection

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** 
using TensorFlow/Keras to classify **banana leaves** into 
various **disease categories**, including healthy leaves. The 
model is trained on a dataset of labeled banana leaf images 
and performs multi-class image classification.

# 2. MODEL OVERVIEW
**MODEL ARCHITECTURE**

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in **Banana-Leaf-Disease-Detection**
is designed to automatically extract features from banana 
leaf images and classify them into one of the disease classes.

**The model has the following architecture:**

The CNN architecture includes:
- 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling
- Dropout layers to reduce overfitting
- A fully connected dense layer
- A softmax output layer for classification

The model is compiled with:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Categorical Crossentropy
- Metric: Accuracy

The model is trained for 100 epochs.

# 3. TRAINING & SAVING

- Training and validation images are augmented for robustness.
- The trained model is saved as:
    model/Banana Disease Recognition_model.h5
- Training history (loss/accuracy) is saved as:
    model/Banana Disease Recognition_history.npy

---
# 4. EVALUATION & VISUALIZATION

- Training vs Validation Loss and Accuracy plots are generated.
- Confusion matrix is visualized using seaborn heatmap.
- Evaluation metrics include:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision (macro avg)
    - Recall (macro avg)
    - F1-score (macro avg)
    - AUC-ROC score (multi-class)
